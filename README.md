- 👋 Hi, I’m instancer-kirik
- 👀 I’m interested in adventures and side quests and free software and 3d and VR and making content eventually, I just want to build tools and features and websites and games and stuff first.
- 🖐 I use(kotlin, js, ue5, elixir, java, python, blender, krita, obsidian, chainsaw, machete, wrenches, highlighters, lockpicks, and zipties)
- 💞️ I have a lot of projects and not enough money to move out. Help and/or show interest on what you'd like me to complete. Also I might become a mariner soon, but I want a ship of my own with cool tools and space. I may just crew for a time on some cargo ship.
